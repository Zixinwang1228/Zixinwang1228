These are my codes for Project1a. 
I modify the getCommandFromInput(), so that the program can take user input and run that command instread of"/bin/ls"
My program can also handle user input with space befroe and after the command, which is space insensitive.
When my user type " ./penn-shredder", system will prompt penn-shredder# and allow user to type input, and if user hit 
Crl+D, then the system exit the shell. If user put "/bin/ls Crl+D" then there will be a list of files in the directory
